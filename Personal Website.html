    <p>Hi everyone, my name is Andy Chen and I'm a sophomore at the University of Maryland. I'm from rural northcentral PA and I'm studying computer science. I'm interested in software and web development, and I'm always looking for more opportunities to learn and grow. Outside of tech, I enjoy fishing, playing basketball, and hanging out with friends. Right now, I'm am looking for an internship opportunities to help immerse myself in the tech world after graduation.  </p>
